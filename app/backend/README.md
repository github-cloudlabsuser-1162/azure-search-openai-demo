## Introduction
This backend application serves as the logic behind our web application. It handles data processing, business logic, database interactions, and server configuration. It is built using Node.js and Express, and it uses MongoDB as its database.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `app/backend` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Set up your MongoDB database and obtain your connection string.
5. Create a `.env` file in the `app/backend` directory and set `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` to your MongoDB connection string.
6. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## Directory Structure
The `app/backend` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `api/`: Contains the routes that define the API endpoints of the application.
- `models/`: Contains the definitions of the database models.
- `services/`: Contains the business logic of the application.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and classes.
- `run.js`: The entry point of the application.

Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file that provides more detailed information about its contents.

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/items`: Retrieves a list of all items. Returns a JSON array of items.
- `POST /api/items`: Creates a new item. Accepts a JSON object with `name` and `description` properties. Returns the created item.

## Error Handling
Errors are handled using middleware in Express. If an error is thrown or passed to `next()`, the error handling middleware will send a response with an error message and a status code. Common error messages include "Item not found" and "Invalid request data".

## Testing
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Run them using the `npm test` command.

## Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker. To build the Docker image, run `docker build -t my-app .`. To run the application in a Docker container, use `docker run -p 8080:8080 my-app`.
