In your app/backend directory, you might have different files or modules handling different parts of this process. For example, you might have:

api/ directory: Contains the routes that define the API endpoints of your application. Each route corresponds to a URL pattern, and each pattern is associated with a function that gets executed when that URL is visited.

models/: Contains the definitions of your database models. Each model represents a table in the database, and the fields in the model represent the columns of the table.

services/: Contains the business logic of your application. This is where you define how your application processes data and interacts with the database.

utils/: Contains utility functions and classes that are used throughout your application.

run.py: This is likely the entry point of your application. Running this file starts up your backend server.
